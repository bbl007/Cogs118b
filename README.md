I am using the “Exo Planeting Hunting in Deep Space” dataset on Kaggle to determine whether a star contains an exoplanet based on the light intensities of the star. I will be trying different binary classification methods, such as logistic regression, ridge regression, and may look into random forest classification. This dataset is interesting due to the large number of parameters and the uniqueness of its premise. The data contains a collection of light intensities for stars over a period of time, the data varies quite a lot due to different aspects of a star. The main difficulty of this problem is that the data is a set of time series data, with its light intensity values varying from star to star. It also only contains less than 1 percent positive hits, making modeling difficult and relatively inaccurate.
